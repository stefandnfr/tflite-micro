# TensorFlow Lite Micro 

This fork was created to ensure portability with the zephyr project. It is supposed to be kept up to date with its origin, and just contains an extra zephyr directory to be able to be pulled from a customized zephyr based software distribution as seen [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/application/index.html#advanced-example-application-usage)
